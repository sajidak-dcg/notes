This document defines the activities that are necessary to successfully exit the __Envision__ phase of product development.

## Prologue:
For a product to be successfull, 
- Feature list should be the greatest common denominator for the target user base. Survey group can never be too large.
- Technologies used for development should be future proof.
- Process discipline must be strictly applied throughout lifecycle.
- Unanimity between stakeholders is critical for success.
- ~~Ensure reasonable contingency buffers for all resources and activities~~.
- 'Be Prepared' for the unexpected at all times.

## Inputs:
### Features
- Identify & document features to be developed
- Prioritize by importance and urgency

### Stakes
- Itemize all resources required for successful RTM
*Itemize everything, however small it may be*
- Resources include IPs, expert knowledge, skill sets, material resources, infrastructure resources, and more...

### Stakehokders
- Identify owners(s) for all stakes
- Each stake must have atleast one owner
- A stake may have more than one owner *depending on size and complexity*.
- Ownership may be transferred between stakeholders, *by mutual consent*, during the lifetime of the product development.

### Risks
- Identify all possible outcomes, especially the worst-case scenarios
- Document mitigation plans for each case.
- A scenario must have atleast one mitigation plan, and may have more than one mitigation plan.

### Roadmap
- Identify realistic milestones (SMART).
- Define target dates for each milestone.
*These dates will be refined, and locked, by end of planning phase*.

## Next Steps:
1. Document, Review and Baseline feature list.
2. Prepare first baseline draft of PMP (Project Management Plan).
	- By end of Planning phase, PMP will be updated with fine details, reviewed by all stakeholders and Baselined.
	- This baselined PMP will be used to monitor and track progress and health of the project.

### Appendix 2: Exit Criteria - Envision
1. All stakes baselined.
2. All stakeholders are on board.
3. Stake ownership(s) baselined.
